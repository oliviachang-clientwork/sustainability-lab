Friends since the seventh grade, we have long recognized the high costs of our consumer culture and shared a vision of a low-carbon, zero-pollution society as the alternative to climate catastrophe. Our individual and collective choices over the next ten years matter more than ever and we believe that our everyday decisions will create/determine the future. We can either continue down this path of ecological degradation or choose a better way—for our actions today will reverberate across our communities and impact future generations to come. <br><br>Our current world setup makes it hard to make environmentally-sound decisions. Things are designed to be convenient and instantaneously gratifying without considering the consequences on our shared planet and health. It’s no surprise that it's hard for people to evaluate whether or not brands are actually sustainable, as many of those same brands add sustainability to their marketing without making meaningful, necessary changes. People don't want to sacrifice on quality or pay extra to find eco-friendly products; most people aren’t able to drop everything for a new zero-waste or vegan lifestyle.<br><br>To realize our vision, we can’t rely on a small group of people doing things perfectly. We need everyone to make some meaningful changes. Sustainability must be inclusive and accessible to all because we all depend on each other to make those meaningful changes, together. <br><br>We’ve launched The Sustainability Lab as an e-commerce shop and digital platform, to make sustainable living the easy, smart choice. We scout for the best products on the market with sustainable DNA so our customers have a one-stop, curated shop—without sacrificing on quality, price, or aesthetics. We also recognize that consumption is only one way to make better decisions, which is why we’re constantly adding new resources, organizations, and ideas via The Lab and our sustainability concierge. Let’s create the future we want, together.<br><br>With gratitude, <br>Elle and Josh<br><br></span></p></div></div></div><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-87b3b5b6 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-c19460fa" data-pf-type="Column"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-de9fc194"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-2ea7de9f">our vision</span></h3></div></div><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-fdc5bf6f" data-pf-type="Column"><p data-pf-type="Paragraph2" class="sc-pkvvt cbrLgP pf-c996fdc5"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-8cc2c996"><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the sustainable future, we will have reimagined our systems, culture, and economy to avoid the climate catastrophe. Our society will be powered by renewable energy; our food will come from our yards and local farmers, who will nourish pollinators and refuse to use pesticides. The supply chain will be ethical, clean, and carbon-free. We’ll get around in electric vehicles, airline companies won’t use fossil fuels, and our public transportation systems will be modernized. Our public health will take its rightful place as a priority as harmful subsidies to support meat production go away in favor of plant-rich diets; our cities and towns will encourage walking and cycling over sedentary, isolating driving. All of that excess healthcare spending will be invested instead in education, infrastructure, housing, and research & development. Rather than 4.6 million people dying every year from air pollution, everyone will be able to breathe clean air. We won't hear stories like those about Flint, Michigan, because our water will be clean, lead-free, and available for all. We’ll swim in our rivers and lakes without fear; our oceans will become plastic-free; our sewage systems won’t leak untreated waste into our beaches. We will replace our suburban sprawl with wilderness, small-scale farms, and clean, local manufacturing. Our skies will be dark at night so birds can migrate safely and we can see the full might of the stars as we were meant to.<br><br>In the sustainable future, our politicians and environmental protection agencies will safeguard our well-being over the profit-and-loss statements of corporations. Our investments will take into account environmental and social goals just as much as a dollar return on investment. Petrochemical and pesticide companies will no longer exist. Marginalized, low-income, communities of color will no longer have toxic waste facilities dumped disproportionally on them: there will be no toxic waste; environmental racism will be eradicated.<br><br>In the sustainable future we imagine, all decisions will take into account the impacts on the planet and people, not just the bottom line or delivery speed. As a part of the circular economy, our stuff will be designed from the beginning to perform better, last longer, be refurbished and reused. We won't have to worry about what to buy, because toxic and unsustainable products won't be sold, and companies that don’t share the values of people and planet won’t exist.<br><br>Nothing will be described as “sustainable,” because everything will be sustainable, by default.&nbsp;<br><br></span><br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-152b8358" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-145b1716 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-9ab8145b" data-pf-type="Column"><img sizes="(min-width: 992px) 1200px, (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) 800px, 400px" srcset="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0286/2327/4056/t/11/assets/pf-9460fa54--Copy-of-about-pages.png?v=1594165032 1200w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0286/2327/4056/t/11/assets/pf-9460fa54--Copy-of-about-pages_800x386.png?v=1594165032&resized 800w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0286/2327/4056/t/11/assets/pf-9460fa54--Copy-of-about-pages_400x193.png?v=1594165032&resized 400w" class="sc-qZtVr dLIPjF pf-580e9ab8" data-pf-type="Image2"></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-88106c6b" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-ec6d8810 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-2620ec6d" data-pf-type="Column"><img sizes="(min-width: 992px) 1200px, (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) 800px, 400px" srcset="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0286/2327/4056/t/11/assets/pf-106c6b27--Copy-of-about-pages-1.png?v=1594165298 1200w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0286/2327/4056/t/11/assets/pf-106c6b27--Copy-of-about-pages-1_800x386.png?v=1594165298&resized 800w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0286/2327/4056/t/11/assets/pf-106c6b27--Copy-of-about-pages-1_400x193.png?v=1594165298&resized 400w" class="sc-qZtVr dLIPjF pf-fa542620" data-pf-type="Image2"><img sizes="(min-width: 992px) 1200px, (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) 800px, 400px" srcset="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0286/2327/4056/t/11/assets/pf-30bc9174--Copy-of-about-pages-2.png?v=1594167024 1200w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0286/2327/4056/t/11/assets/pf-30bc9174--Copy-of-about-pages-2_800x386.png?v=1594167024&resized 800w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0286/2327/4056/t/11/assets/pf-30bc9174--Copy-of-about-pages-2_400x193.png?v=1594167024&resized 400w" class="sc-qZtVr dLIPjF pf-fd30bc91" data-pf-type="Image2"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>
