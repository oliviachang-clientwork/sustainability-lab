We are, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We believe that we need a lot of people to make some meaningful changes that collectively can have a profound impact on the planet, our communities, and even us. You don’t have to be zero waste, vegan, or a DIY queen to live in a way that is significantly better for our environment and health. We’re not here to advocate for any one version of sustainability, unless that’s something you want to pursue. We’re here to encourage you to begin and deepen the exploration process of what living more sustainably can mean for you, given all the details of your individual life. <br><br>What can you do to live more sustainably?

Eat a variety of foods that are local, fresh and in season, and enjoy the experience of eating—mindfully and with gratitude. Planning your meals in advance, meeting yourself and the people you share meals with where you/they are, and not changing your entire lifestyle cold turkey will help. Consider cutting meat out of one meal a day or on specific days of the week to get started. See if&nbsp; a friend, partner, roommate, or co-worker wants to try eating less meat with you.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/dining/flexitarian-eating-less-meat.html" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline;" target="_self">This NYT article</a> has some great tips on how to actually embrace more plants and eat less meat:<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">+ Eat more beans. </span>Chickpeas, cannellini, lintels, lima beans, black beans. Beans are a great source of protein and can be used in so many ways.&nbsp;<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">+ Enjoy high-protein grains (including pasta). </span>Quinoa, millet, wild rice, buckwheat, cornmeal, kamut, teff (we bet you haven't even heard of all these gems). Having a wide variety of carb bases for your dishes will make it easier to keep things interesting.&nbsp;<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">+ Up your tofu game. </span>Tofu is what you make of it and you can do so much with it. Given its mild, neutral flavor, tofu can be paired with more flavorful ingredients and sauces. Alternatively, you can combine a small amount of meat with tofu for the flavor but for a fraction of the meat.&nbsp;<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">+ More nuts and seeds. </span>Mmhm almond butter...but also so many other ways to add nuts and seeds into your diet. Chopped on salads, pureed into dressing and sauces, nut butter, and just plain, as a snack, are some tasty ways to pack in more protein.&nbsp;<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">+ Try plant-based meats.</span> There are so many options on the market nowadays: seitan, veggie burgers, soy chorizo, tempeh, jackfruit, plant-based "chicken." New companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are coming up all kinds of meat alternatives.<br><br>If you do continue to eat meat, make it an active and informed choice by understanding where those products come from and how they are raised (grass-fed has a much smaller footprint than conventional grain-fed cattle). Remind yourself that eating meat comes with consequences, but that we can still be good stewards of the planet if we don't give it all up, all at once.&nbsp;<br><br></span></p></div></div><div class="sc-pJipy mZVAk pf-f9b281c9 accordion__item" data-pf-type="Accordion2.Content.Wrapper"><button type="button" class="sc-pBlxj gYSgcm pf-6c6fa774 accordion__header pf-anchor" data-header-id="b86c6fa7-74f9-4281-89c5-b8dff4230642" data-action="accordion2" data-preopen="false" data-active="false" data-pf-type="Accordion.Header"><i class="icon_position fa fa-plus"></i>Get renewables and conserve energy</button><div class="sc-qYUWV exYsxy pf-a774f9b2 accordion__content" mode="view" data-id="b86c6fa7-74f9-4281-89c5-b8dff4230642" data-pf-type="Accordion2.Content" style="display: none;"><p data-pf-type="Paragraph2" class="sc-pkvvt cbrLgP pf-dff42306"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-c5b8dff4">We cannot achieve carbon neutrality without decarbonizing our entire energy system.

In some places, like New York City, 34% of the residential waste stream is made of compostable organics like yard waste and food scraps. Organics collection provides benefits for the environment, regional economy, and local communities. Diverting organics from landfills prevents GHG emissions and can be used for composting to create a nutrient-dense soil amendment or to generate renewable energy.<br> <br>More organics collected means more organics recycling projects, which will create new jobs in planning, construction, and operations. Ultimately our food waste can be a resource that is used for productive measures rather than being sent to landfills. Cutting-edge companies like Veles are using food waste to create innovative products.&nbsp;<br><br>Check your local municipality's website for more information about organics pickup availability and drop-off locations. <a href="https://sharewaste.com/" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline;" target="_self">ShareWaste</a> maps out local composting systems.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div class="sc-pJipy mZVAk pf-5c242034 accordion__item" data-pf-type="Accordion2.Content.Wrapper"><button type="button" class="sc-pBlxj gYSgcm pf-4bb5cf0c accordion__header pf-anchor" data-header-id="794bb5cf-0cb2-4d5c-a420-346d3f62e8b8" data-action="accordion2" data-preopen="false" data-active="false" data-pf-type="Accordion.Header"><i class="icon_position fa fa-plus"></i>Use low-carbon modes of transportation</button><div class="sc-qYUWV exYsxy pf-125f2ab2 accordion__content" mode="view" data-id="794bb5cf-0cb2-4d5c-a420-346d3f62e8b8" data-pf-type="Accordion2.Content" style="display: none;"><p data-pf-type="Paragraph2" class="sc-pkvvt cbrLgP pf-56e9bc2a"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-1e7c56e9"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Transportation is the largest source of carbon emissions in the US. </span><br>- <span style="font-weight: bold;">Walk, bike, scooter, or take public transportation. </span><br>- Consider <span style="font-weight: bold;">car-sharing</span> or renting a car only when you need it, or carpooling when possible.

Some airlines like JetBlue, Alaskan Airlines, Air Canada, Delta, etc. offer the option to offset your carbon footprint when purchasing your flight ticket. Each airline has its own program, often in partnership with organizations that fund projects across energy efficiency, renewable energy, land use, methane destruction, and more. <br><br>While offsetting your flight is important, the global aviation industry is responsible for about 2% of all man-made carbon emissions compared to 20% created by road transport and fuel combustion.
